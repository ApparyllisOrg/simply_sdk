SDK for the Apparyllis API. (https://github.com/Apparyllis/ApparyllisApi)

## Components

Main functionality currently consists of:
* Storing Authentication received from the Firebase SDK
* Batch writing to the API
* Streams to listen to changes in the Database from the API
* Offline persistence (A small version of the online API that doesn't do any security checks and 
* Offline ressurection (Works with Offline Persistence in that it sends data that was created while offline) (TODO)
